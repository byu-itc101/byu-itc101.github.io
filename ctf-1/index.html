    <h1>CTF #1: Introduction to Capture the Flag</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      In this assignment you’ll learn what CTFs are, how flags work, and how to
      use picoCTF and its web shell to solve a simple challenge.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a flag?</h2>
    <p>
      A flag is a piece of text that proves you solved a challenge. In picoCTF,
      flags look like <code>picoCTF{...}</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spend at least 15 minutes on each challenge before using hints.</li>
      <li>
        You can use the internet or AI tools, but use them to learn concepts,
        not to just get the answer.
      </li>
      <li>Take ownership of your learning and experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: First Grep on picoCTF</h2>
    <p>
      In this example you’ll log in to picoCTF, open the <strong>First Grep</strong>
      challenge, download the file using the web shell, and search it with
      <code>grep</code> to find the flag.
    </p>

    <!-- Example image – you'll hook this up in steps 2–3 -->
    <!-- <img src="first-grep-page.png" alt="First Grep challenge page on picoCTF"> -->

    <h2>Turning in CTF #1</h2>
    <p>
      When you complete the challenge, submit the flag in picoCTF and take a
      screenshot showing your username, the challenge name, and the completed
      icon. Paste that screenshot into the CTF #1 assignment on Learning Suite.

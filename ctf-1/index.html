      <h1>CTF Introduction #1</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This document introduces Capture the Flags (CTFs), a popular
      cybersecurity game which cybersecurity professionals use to develop and
      test practical cybersecurity skills. A CTF will typically be split up
      into several categories (for example: Cryptography, Web Exploitation,
      Reverse Engineering, etc.) with challenges ranging in difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end goal of a challenge is to collect a <strong>flag</strong>, which
      is a plaintext code that indicates your completion of the challenge. We
      will assign CTFs throughout the semester to test your knowledge of certain
      topics and because they are fun!
    </p>

    <h2>What is a flag?</h2>
    <p>
      The flag will typically be in the format:
      <code>name{FLAG}</code>, with the <code>name</code> generally stemming
      from the CTF name and the <code>FLAG</code> being a code or text placed
      between the curly brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our purposes, we will use <strong>picoCTF</strong>, a free online CTF
      hosted every year that keeps some of its challenges up for practice.
      However, there are many other CTFs for you to try! HackTheBox, Google,
      SaintCon, and even BYU’s CSA (Cybersecurity Student Association) club host
      CTFs, many of which also have challenges available year-round.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need to create a free picoCTF account at:
      <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/register"
        >https://play.picoctf.org/register</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sign up using the relevant information (for example, your student email
      and NetID). Remember your password because you will enter it into a
      command line interface (the shell).
    </p>
    <p>Now we can start learning some technology and start CTFs!</p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
      Do not use walkthroughs or get help from peers until you have spent at
      least <strong>15 minutes</strong> on each CTF. There are hints on
      picoCTF that you can use, but do not use them until you are stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are encouraged to search the internet, ask your favorite LLM, or
      discuss with peers, but do not have them just give you the answer.
      Instead, have them explain concepts and technologies that are confusing so
      that you can then make the needed intellectual jump to solve the CTF
      challenge. In other words, <strong>take ownership of your learning!</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Example CTF: First Grep</h2>
    <p>
      For our example, we are going to do the <strong>First Grep</strong>
      challenge together as it shows various technologies you are going to use
      for many challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, navigate to the challenge. Head to the
      <strong>Practice</strong> tab and scroll to see the challenge. If it is
      not there, search for it using the search bar on the left.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image001.png" alt="picoCTF practice challenges list showing First Grep" />
      <figcaption>Finding the First Grep challenge in picoCTF.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Note that First Grep is faded for me with the green person icon in the
      top right corner because I have already completed it. It should be more
      visible with a gray person icon for you.
    </p>
    <p>Now click on it and you will see this:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image002.png" alt="First Grep challenge page" />
      <figcaption>The First Grep challenge details page.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      For many challenges, you need to turn on the instance. Click the
      <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button and more information will pop up,
      including the link to the website. This is <em>not</em> necessary for
      First Grep; there is no instance. This is what it would look like if you
      needed to launch one:
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image003.png" alt="Example of an active picoCTF challenge instance" />
      <figcaption>Example of a challenge that uses a launched instance.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now, let’s read the description:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image004.png" alt="First Grep challenge description and download link" />
      <figcaption>Description and file download link for First Grep.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      This description is telling us we are going to be looking for a flag
      through a lot of information and gives us a link to download a file.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the web shell</h2>
    <p>
      We are going to use something called the <strong>web shell</strong> to do
      this. A shell is a place where we can interact with an operating system,
      in this case Linux. Since it is an operating system, we can download files
      into a file system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to use this shell to practice because we all need to learn Linux
      commands as they are very important for your cybersecurity career! (Plus,
      if you download the file onto your own system, sometimes you can find a
      flag in an unintended way and will not learn anything.)
    </p>
    <p>The web shell is located on the right side of the screen:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image005.png" alt="picoCTF web shell button on challenge page" />
      <figcaption>Opening the web shell from the challenge page.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Click on it and it will prompt you to put in your username and password.
      These are the same as when you log in to picoCTF.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image006.png" alt="picoCTF web shell login prompt" />
      <figcaption>Logging into the web shell with your picoCTF credentials.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>When you are logged in, it should show something like this:</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image007.png" alt="picoCTF web shell terminal view" />
      <figcaption>The web shell after successfully logging in.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      It might look a little different for you depending on your username. But
      now we have access to the shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shell is one of the most powerful tools you will use in this entire
      program and in your career. Use it often and learn it! (Disclaimer: the
      shell provided by picoCTF has a lot of packages installed, so it may have
      more functionality than your personal shell right now.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more about it, read:
      <a href="https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell"
        >https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="tip">TIP:</span> If you click the second icon in the bar, it
      will pop out the shell into a new tab, giving you more space.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image008.png" alt="picoCTF shell toolbar with pop-out icon" />
      <figcaption>Use the toolbar icon to pop the shell into its own tab.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Downloading the challenge file</h2>
    <p>Ok, so we have this shell and the file. How do we get this file into the shell?</p>

    <p>This is where the most important part of the CTF methodology comes into play:</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold;">
      YOU CAN USE GOOGLE / AI TO HELP YOU!!!
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important part of CTFs is learning how to research to solve
      problems. In the workforce, you will be solving problems you have never
      seen before. Learning how to find answers is key!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the shell, there are many commands that do different things. There is
      probably a command to solve our problem. Let’s use Google.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image009.png" alt="Google search for linux command to get file from internet" />
      <figcaption>Searching for a Linux command to download a file.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      I typed <em>&quot;linux command to get file from internet&quot;</em>
      because that’s what we need to do!
    </p>

    <p><span class="tip">Tip:</span> Remember to be specific when using Google or AI. If you type in garbage, you will get a garbage response.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image010.png" alt="Search result showing wget usage" />
      <figcaption>Search results explaining the <code>wget</code> command.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>It even tells us how to use it! Let’s go back to picoCTF.</p>

    <p>Right-click the file link in the challenge and select <strong>Copy link address</strong>.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image011.png" alt="Right-click menu to copy file link" />
      <figcaption>Copying the link to the challenge file.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Now let’s head back to the shell. Type <code>wget</code> and then paste
      the link address.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Paste in a shell on Windows is <code>Ctrl + Shift + V</code>.
      <code>Ctrl + V</code> means something different in a shell. You can also
      right-click and choose Paste.)
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image012.png" alt="Using wget in the shell with the copied URL" />
      <figcaption>Downloading the file in the web shell using <code>wget</code>.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Press Enter to run the command. Then type <code>ls</code> (short for
      <em>list</em>) to see all the files in the directory and you should see a
      file named <code>file</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Solving First Grep</h2>
    <p>Now let’s actually do the challenge.</p>

    <h3>Inspecting the file</h3>
    <p>
      In the description of the challenge, we are going to be going through a
      lot of data. Let’s see what the file contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you type <code>cat file</code>, this shows the text contained in the
      file and... it’s a bunch of garbage.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image013.png" alt="Output of cat file showing lots of random text" />
      <figcaption>Viewing the file contents with <code>cat file</code>.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>But we know that some command can help us. Which one though?</p>
    <p><span class="tip">Tip:</span> The title of a CTF can be a hint on how to solve it.</p>

    <p>
      The title is <strong>First Grep</strong>... is there a command called
      <code>grep</code>? Let’s look it up!
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image014.png" alt="Search results for linux grep command" />
      <figcaption>Searching for information about the <code>grep</code> command.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>There is a <code>grep</code> command, and it can search for patterns in files. That seems promising.</p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image015.png" alt="Documentation snippet explaining grep usage" />
      <figcaption>Docs explaining how to use <code>grep</code>.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Every flag on picoCTF starts with <code>picoCTF</code>, so let’s search
      for that pattern in the file!
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image016.png" alt="Shell command using grep picoCTF file" />
      <figcaption>Using <code>grep picoCTF file</code> to search for the flag.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In the shell, type:
      <code>grep picoCTF file</code> and press Enter.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image017.png" alt="grep output showing the picoCTF flag" />
      <figcaption>The flag found inside the file by <code>grep</code>!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>That is the flag! Awesome work.</p>

    <h2>Turning in CTFs</h2>
    <p>Now we need to turn it in. Copy the flag from the shell.</p>
    <p>
      Go back to the picoCTF website and the First Grep challenge. You will see
      a box to input the flag. When submitting flags, be sure to include the
      <strong>whole flag</strong>, including the name and curly brackets, and
      not just the contents.
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image018.png" alt="Flag submission box on the picoCTF challenge page" />
      <figcaption>Submitting the flag in picoCTF.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Paste it in and hit Submit. You have officially completed your first CTF!
    </p>

    <p>
      When we have CTF assignments, submission will be a little weird, since the
      flags change a little between runs.
    </p>

    <p>Go to the CTF #1 assignment in Learning Suite.</p>
    <p>
      To verify that you have completed the CTF, we will need a screenshot of
      the completed screen like this:
    </p>

    <figure class="screenshot">
      <img src="image019.png" alt="Completed challenge screen in picoCTF" />
      <figcaption>
        Make sure your username, the name of the challenge, and the completed
        green icon are visible.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Make sure your username, the name of the challenge, and the completed
      green person icon are in the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paste the screenshot into the assignment on Learning Suite and you are
      officially done!

      <h1>CTF #4: OSINT Tools</h1>
      <p>IT&amp;C 101 - Intro to Cybersecurity</p>
    </header>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is widely used in the real world to
      gather information from publicly available sources such as social media,
      news articles, government reports, and websites. Penetration Tests start
      with OSINT about a company, seeing if they can find any information about
      the company, workers, or maybe information about security! Law enforcement
      agencies use OSINT to track criminal activity, investigate fraud, and
      locate suspects. You have probably used OSINT to “stalk” people’s
      Instagram! This CTF is designed to teach you different real OSINT tools,
      such as the Wayback Machine so that you can (ETHICALLY) use them in other
      CTFs, real world engagements, or for fun!
    </p>

    <h2>WayBack Machine</h2>
    <p>
      The Way Back Machine is a tool built by the Internet Archive that takes
      snapshots of websites as they once were for safekeeping, research,
      journalism etc. It preserves the history of the Internet. We will be using
      it to learn information about websites from a different time. Answer these
      questions about various websites; there should be only one answer for
      each.

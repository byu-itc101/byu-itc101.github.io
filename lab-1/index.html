    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <p class="prompt">
      What are some cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the US and why? (Consider moments in the documentary where specific vulnerabilities were discussed and explain their significance.)
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response ~75 words]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      Risk consists of the likelihood of something happening (e.g., a certain attack) multiplied by the impact of it happening (i.e., the effects of it). Describe an example of how an organization in the film miscalculated risk and speculate on why they miscalculated.
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response ~75 words]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      Cybersecurity attacks lead to breaches in confidentiality, integrity, and availability (the CIA Triad). Describe one example of each from the movie and why it matches the definition of a breach in the specified security service:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Confidentiality breach:</strong></p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response ~75 words]</p>
    <p><strong>Integrity breach:</strong></p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response ~75 words]</p>
    <p><strong>Availability breach:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>How do they meet the definition of a threat actor?</li>
      <li>What goals and intentions do they have toward their adversarial country?</li>

      <li>What prompts them to act or not?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response ~75 words]</p>

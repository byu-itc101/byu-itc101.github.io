    <h2>PURPOSE:</h2>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity requires a broad knowledge of computing skills that involve
      a variety of software and hardware. The term “Information Technology” is
      used differently by those in the profession, the news media, and others;
      the same is true of “Cybersecurity”. The purpose of this assignment is to
      find out what an actual expert thinks about IT&amp;C.
    </p>

    <h2>LAB PROCEDURE:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your interview will focus on the basics of Cybersecurity and what it is.
        Interview one person that works in Cybersecurity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interview the person using the questionnaire (included at the end of
        this assignment sheet) about their opinions on IT or cybersecurity and
        how they use these terms, but you can also include any questions that
        you feel are pertinent to the conversation.
      </li>
      <li>
        As you interview the participants, record the person’s responses on a
        copy of the questionnaire.
      </li>
      <li>Summarize your findings in your lab report.</li>
      <li>
        Please be respectful to the professional who is giving you the
        interview. Their time is valuable and should not be wasted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FORMAT:</h2>
    <p>
      Fill out the questions from the list below and then write a summary of
      what you learned beneath. Write it so that the reader of this report
      should be able to easily identify the following formatting criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who wrote the report?</li>
      <li>What is the purpose of your study?</li>
      <li>Summarize the results for each of the open-ended questions (found at the end of the questionnaire).</li>
      <li>Describe several things you learned from this lab.</li>
      <li>Include a summary of what you learned</li>
      <li>Include the questionnaire with the individual responses in an appendix</li>
      <li>Format your lab report in such a way that the reader can quickly go to a specific question to read.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>DUE</strong> at 11:59 PM on the given due date</p>
    <p>
      Submit an electronic copy of your lab write through the Learning Suite
      page for IT&amp;C 101 --&gt; Grades--&gt; Lab1--&gt; Submit
    </p>

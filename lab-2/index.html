    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      As an IT&C student, you will need to be familiar with the command line,
      which you will use extensively throughout your time at BYU and career.
      This lab is to help teach you principles on using the command line and
      other utilities available via the command line such as “vim” (a document
      editor). For this lab, much of your education will be self-driven (you
      won’t get much out of it doing the bare minimum). Professors and employers
      alike will encourage you to learn things on your own.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Learn about and apply the Linux command line and vim by completing various
      CLI exercises.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to Linux Survival at <a href="https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/">https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/</a>.</li>
      <li>Read the information about the Linux Command line.</li>
      <li>Take all 4 quizzes. Include screenshots of the 4 quizzes in your submission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vim</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://www.vim-hero.com/">https://www.vim-hero.com/</a></li>
      <li>Do the challenges of navigating through Vim</li>
      <li>Take screenshots of your results from 3 challenges (they should show speed, accuracy, proficiency)</li>
      <li>Try the bug review game at the end of the Basic Vim section. You do not have to fully complete it, but it is a fun review!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>
      Submit a single Word docx file or pdf file that includes screenshots of
      showing your completion along with answers to the following questions. You
      can copy and paste these questions and enter your responses after each
      one:

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p class="prompt">What experience did you have using CLI before this lab?</p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      What do you understand about CLI functions now that you didn’t know before?
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      Describe the functions of 4 new commands that you didn’t know before and a
      real-world situation (i.e., use-case) where you could use them to
      accomplish a goal. If you already knew all of the commands, then look up 4
      new ones.
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">How might you implement CLI knowledge in your daily tasks?</p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      In what ways might a profession of your interest take advantage of CLI
      skills (e.g., how might the CLI be used by a security analyst, system
      administrator, reverse engineer, secure developer)?

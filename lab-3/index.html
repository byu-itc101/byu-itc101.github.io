    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      As an IT&C student, gaining a deep understanding of security controls is
      essential, as they form the foundation of protecting information systems.
      These controls—ranging from administrative policies to advanced technical
      implementations—will be tools you rely on extensively during your time at
      BYU and throughout your career in the cybersecurity field.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lab is designed to introduce you to the principles and application of
      security controls through an interactive Security Information and Event
      Management (SIEM) tutorial and lab. In this exercise, you will analyze a
      simulated environment to identify and evaluate implemented security
      controls. By investigating logs, alerts, and system configurations, you
      will gain practical experience in detecting, responding to, and mitigating
      security threats. You may not understand all of the language and
      terminology found in the simulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Before beginning review the security controls found at
        <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list"
          >https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        You will complete the SIEM simulation, at the end take a screenshot of
        the congratulations page to record completion.
      </li>
      <li>After completing the simulation answer the questions listed at the bottom of the lab file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/introtosiem">https://tryhackme.com/room/introtosiem</a> and make an account.  After making your account in the search bar search Introduction SIEM.  You should see this:
      </li>
      <li>Click on the lab and complete it.</li>
      <li>
        Take a screenshot of the completion with Room Progress at 100% (after
        you finish).
      </li>
      <li>After completing the simulation answer the questions listed at the bottom. Don’t worry that you don’t know all of the language and terminology found in the simulation. This lab is to introduce you to the kinds of risks, threats, and associated alerts you might experience as a defender and the security controls that you might implement as protections.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>Submit a single Word docx file or pdf file that includes screenshots of showing your completion along with answers to the following questions. You can copy and paste these questions and enter your responses after each one:</p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p class="prompt">
      What is a security control that you could implement to deter an attacker who was trying to install an unwanted file or program on your network like the one found in the simulation?
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      How would you implement a security control to protect against such a threat?
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      What are examples of physical security controls? What are some real-world examples in which you could implement said security controls?
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      What are examples of technical security controls? What are some real-world examples in which you could implement said security controls?
    </p>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      What did you most enjoy about this lab, and is there anything you'd
      suggest to improve it?

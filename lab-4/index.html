    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this activity is to consider how information can and is
      weaponized. Sadly, we live in a world where there are many people who
      inadvertently share misinformation or intentionally share disinformation.
      For example, foreign governments run disinformation campaigns, often
      called Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) to promote
      their worldview in other countries. More locally, politicians and
      companies can spread disinformation to promote their causes. It is
      important to inoculate ourselves against such information attacks if we
      are to see the world as it really is.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      Watch the documentary After Truth. You can access it via the library’s
      Kanopy website. As you watch it, try not to focus on the specific
      political messages, so much as the techniques that are used to deceive and
      the reasons people are susceptible to deception. Once you have watched the
      film, answer the questions below and upload a file to learningsuite with
      the answers to the questions in them.
    </p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p class="prompt">
      Describe a technique that disinformation spreaders used to achieve their
      goals. For each one describe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the adversary’s goal?</li>
      <li>What technique(s) did they use to achieve their goal?</li>
      <li>Why were the techniques effective or not effective in achieving their goal?</li>
      <li>What ethical principle(s) did they violate?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">Describe another technique using a different example.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the adversary’s goal?</li>
      <li>What technique(s) did they use to achieve their goal?</li>
      <li>Why were the techniques effective or not effective in achieving their goal?</li>
      <li>What ethical principle(s) did they violate?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="placeholder">[Your response]</p>

    <p class="prompt">
      Share an example from your own life of misinformation or disinformation
      that you are likely to be susceptible to by answering the following
      sub-questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Describe a scenario where someone may share disinformation that you might fall for.
      </li>
      <li>Why would you be more likely to be susceptible to this disinformation?</li>
      <li>What could you do to be less likely to fall for it?</li>
      <li>
        Why is it particularly important for cybersecurity professionals to not be deceived by disinformation?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Making products and services usable and secure is critical in reducing
      frustration and risk for users. Creating such solutions is best done when
      usability and security are considered from the start, not “tacked on”
      after a product is nearly ready to release. The purpose of this
      assignment. Is to give you experience with the user experience design and
      prototyping process with a security mindset.
    </p>

    <h2>Lab Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      This assignment should be done as a pair assignment (with 2 people),
      though if there is an odd number 3 people can join together. The basic
      steps are to find a partner, choose an activity that you can
      observe/interview other people doing (to identify opportunities for
      technical interventions), brainstorm possible technical solutions based on
      your observations, create 2 low-fidelity prototypes of a technology to
      help with the activity, evaluate risk and security controls to mitigate
      them, and get feedback on your prototype from potential users. Details are
      provided below. Note that all bolded text below will become part of your
      write up that you turn in for the assignment.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose a partner to work with to complete this lab. If there is an odd
        number of students, please talk to the instructor. We suggest choosing a
        partner that you do not know, but it’s up to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose an everyday activity that people around you accomplish regularly
        with or without the use of technology. Write a 1-sentence description of
        your activity. (e.g., “Ordering and receiving food at the Wilk food
        court”). For this assignment you’ll want to choose an activity that
        meets the following criteria:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It’s not too complicated (e.g., designing an airplane; filling out
            your taxes) or too simple (e.g., crossing the street, looking out a
            window). If there are several steps or related tasks involved, but
            not dozens or hundreds then you’re probably good.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s common enough that you can find people around you (ideally who
            are not just like you – i.e., Cyber majors, …) who you can observe
            and interview about the activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is some security-related component. This could relate to
            physical security, personal data security, opportunities of
            adversaries to manipulate results, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you can’t think of anything, check the list in Appendix 1 for
            some inspiration.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Observe and interview at least 4 individuals (2 each) to identify user
        needs. These people cannot be part of the class and shouldn’t be people
        just like you (i.e., same major, ways of doing things…). The point is to
        have empathy for others who may do things differently than you do. If
        possible, observe them performing the activity that you are studying. If
        needed, you can ask them to perform the activity with you watching, but
        make sure they do what they would normally do, and don’t change what
        they’re doing too much because of your observation. Take observational
        notes on what you see including written notes and, if appropriate,
        photos. Don’t video them, since then you won’t be forced to narrow your
        focus to the key observations. After your observations (which may last
        from 5-10 minutes per person), ask the person some questions about what
        you observed and the activity in general. You should write up some of
        the questions beforehand so you are prepared. The questions should help
        you identify what is frustrating about the activity for them, what they
        like about the activity, potential risks associated with the activity,
        how the activity relates to the rest of their life, what technologies
        they use to help them with the activity, and/or why they don’t use other
        technologies. Take notes on how they respond to your questions.
        Summarize your observations and interview notes in at least 4 key
        “takeaway” messages that will help you remember the users’ perspective
        in your future work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brainstorm technological “interventions” with your partner that could
        help those you observed have a better user experience while performing
        their activity. This should take into consideration the interviews and
        observations. During the brainstorming phase there are no bad ideas!
        Feel free to brainstorm with others as well, as there are never too many
        people for brainstorming. List at least 12 different ideas from your
        brainstorming activity. After brainstorming is complete, choose the idea
        that you agree on as the best potential “intervention.” Describe the
        core of your idea in a 2-3 sentence summary (e.g., “We will design a
        mobile app that allows users to find and join Ultimate Frisbee pickup
        games. It will include pickup game times, locations, and keep track of
        who commits to come and actually shows up.”)
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify 3 possible attacks on the system, one of which relates to
        Confidentiality, on related to Integrity, and one related to
        Availability. For each attack identify who a likely threat actor would
        be (i.e., who would have reason to perform such an attack), why they
        would want to attack, and how they would attack it. Then, for each
        possible attack, identify at least one technique you will use to
        minimize the risk of a successful attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design a technological solution that is as usable and secure as
        possible. Create a 6-8 frame storyboard (i.e., comic strip) of your
        activity being completed using your technological intervention. You can
        do this using online tools or, more likely, just hand-drawn. You should
        have a sentence underneath each frame that conveys the core idea of the
        particular frame. An example from Interaction Design Foundation is
        included below:
      </li>
      <li>
        Create 2 low-fidelity prototypes of a technological “interface” (e.g.,
        mobile app, website, large-display, gesture-based interface, car
        dashboard,…) that would be used in your technological “intervention.”
        Paper prototypes are great, though if you get ambitious you could use a
        low-fidelity prototyping tool such as Balsamiq or even Powerpoint. The
        two interfaces should perform the exact same functionality, but do so in
        a different way (i.e., one may have a drop-down menu, while the other
        may list the items as buttons; one may be designed as a large display
        mounted on the wall, while another would be for a mobile device).
        Creating multiple prototypes allows you to keep your thinking from
        getting too constrained by a single one and allows others to give more
        meaningful feedback (see next bullet).
      </li>
      <li>
        Get feedback on your 2 prototypes from at least 2 people. List at least
        4 things they liked and 4 things they didn’t like about your prototypes.
        List at least 2 ways you would improve one of your prototypes based on
        that feedback. You do not need to actually make the improvements to the
        designs, as that is beyond the scope of this lab.
      </li>
    </ol>

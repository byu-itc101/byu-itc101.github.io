      <p><strong>Hash Functions</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Lab: Verifying Integrity of a Download</strong></p>
      <p>
        In this assignment you will verify that a file you download has not been
        changed during download. Go to the site
        <a href="https://md5file.com/calculator">https://md5file.com/calculator</a>.
        Take the four files and run them through the hash generator—you should
        see that the md5 hash for File_1 was <code>e52bb268b3a9354195d85e907cf9c550</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now take the files 2-4 and check the hashes for them. You are looking
        for the file that has the md5 hash of
        <code>e286aa31b76d943fe17eb3daece39cb5</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lab files and template:
        <a href="../assets/Lab7.zip">assets/Lab7.zip</a> and
        <a href="../assets/Lab7.docx">assets/Lab7.docx</a>.
      </p>
    </header>

    <h2>What to submit</h2>
    <p>In the Word file, include your answers to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which file had the matching md5 hash?</li>
      <li>
        What is your conclusion if the provided MD5 hash value is the same as
        the one you calculated? Explain.
      </li>
      <li>
        What is your conclusion if the provided MD5 hash value is different from
        the one you calculated? Explain.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the provided hash value is the same as the one you calculated, does
        that mean that this is absolutely the right file that delivers what it
        promises, or could it be malicious? Explain.
      </li>
      <li>
        How could a second hash value (such as SHA256, in this case) help to
        verify the integrity of the download? Explain.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 2 – Public Key Cryptography</h2>
    <p><strong>Lab: Public Key (Asymmetric) encryption</strong></p>
    <p>
      In this lab activity you will pair with a classmate and send each other
      encrypted messages using a program called OpenSSL.
    </p>

    <h3>Part 1: Key Generation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Windows Users: You will have to use WSL instead of the normal
        windows terminal since OpenSSL is already downloaded on WSL but not on
        the windows terminal.
      </li>
      <li>For Mac Users OpenSSL is already on your computer in the normal terminal.</li>
      <li>From now on the instructions should be the same for either mac or window users.</li>
      <li>Somewhere on your computer create a folder named encryption.</li>
      <li>
        You will now create your Asymmetric keys. On your Terminal or WSL
        navigate to the folder where you want your keys to appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type in the command but replace the &lt;PRIVATE KEY NAME&gt; with whatever
        you want your private key to be named.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out &lt;PRIVATE KEY NAME&gt;.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096</code></p>
    <p>
      You will now see the .pem file with your private key name. You will now
      need to create your public key.
    </p>
    <p>In the same folder where your private key is run this command</p>
    <p><code>openssl rsa -pubout -in &lt;PRIVATE KEY NAME&gt;.pem -out &lt;PUBLIC KEY NAME&gt;.pem</code></p>
    <p>You should now have two .pem files in your folder</p>

    <h3>Part 2: Encryption</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start a text file and write your full name and a message for your
        partner in this file. Save it as yournamePlain.txt. (For example, my
        file would be yesemPlain.txt)
      </li>
      <li>
        You can create this file by using the nano command followed by whatever
        you want your file to be named for example “nano example.txt” would open
        a blank file name example.txt that you can write things in. Create this
        file in the same folder as your private and public keys.
      </li>
      <li>To encrypt this file in the same folder as your private key.</li>
      <li>
        Use the command
        <code>openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;.pem -in &lt;YOUR TXT FILE NAME&gt;.txt -out &lt;ENCRYPTED FILE NAME&gt;.bin</code>
      </li>
      <li>This command should output a .bin file that is an encrypted version of your txt file.</li>
      <li>Send the private key file to your partner via email along with the encrypted .bin file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 3: Decryption</h3>
    <p>
      Upon receiving your partner’s encrypted message, you can now decrypt it
      with their private key. A note that each partner needs to create public
      and private keys encrypt a message and send both their encrypted message
      and private key to their partner for decryption.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Put both your partners private key and their encrypted message in the same folder.</li>
      <li>Open the terminal and navigate to that terminal. Run the command</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey &lt;PRIVATE KEY NAME&gt;.pem -in &lt;ENCRYPTED FILE NAME&gt;.bin -out &lt;DECRYPTED FILE NAME&gt;.txt</code></p>
    <p>
      Find the decrypted file in your working directory and view the message.
      Take a screenshot of the message to include in your submission.
    </p>

    <h3>What to submit (Parts 1–3)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy the screenshots you took in each part into this file. Include your and your partner’s names in the file. Label the screenshots Part 1, Part 2.</li>
      <li>Provide answers to the following questions:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Explain the steps you took in decrypting the message from your partner.</li>
      <li>
        What information did you need from your partner? How did you obtain it?
        Was it a good (secure) way to obtain the information? Explain.
      </li>
      <li>Why would someone use symmetric encryption instead of asymmetric encryption?</li>
      <li>What advantages does asymmetric encryption instead of symmetric encryption?</li>
      <li>If you wanted to send a confidential message to Bob, what key should you encrypt it with?</li>
      <li>
        Do you think you have a good understanding of how public key encryption/decryption works as a result of this activity? Why or why not?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Part 3: Verifying Message Identity and Integrity</h2>
    <p>
      In this final section of the lab, you will apply the knowledge you've
      gained to verify both the identity and integrity of received messages.
      Within the provided lab zip file, you'll find three files:
      secret_message_1 and secret_message_2 and secret_message_3. All these
      files have been encrypted using my public key. Your task is to determine
      which one contains the actual message by using my encrypted hash, also
      known as my digital signature. This signature is included in the lab
      materials. The Hash will be an MD5 version of the message. You can use the
      website provided in the earlier section to get the hashes.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Which file was my message?</li>
      <li>How can you know which one?</li>
      <li>What did the message say?</li>
      <li>Picture please!!!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, answer the following questions, reflecting on your experience with this assignment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the most challenging part of this activity?</li>
      <li>What was the most enjoyable part of this activity?</li>
    </ul>
